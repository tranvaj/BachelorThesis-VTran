Automatic Creation of Summaries of Historical Documents

Structure:
    Application_and_libraries 
    - Contains .py and .ipynb files for training, evaluation and text summarization of mT5, Mistral 7B and TST. Also contains M7B-SC and M7B-POC QLORAs (3rd checkpoint).
    - Contains singular "config.cfg" file for setting various constants and paths.
    - If you are unfamiliar with .ipynb files, please check the Jupyter Notebook documentation https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/

    Input_data 
    - Contains data used for training, such as SumeCzech** and POC dataset and its various forms used during training such as POC_P or POC test set.

    Results 
    - Contains evaluation results for M7B-POC (3rd checkpoint), mT5-SC and TST.
    - Also includes modified POC datasets that additionally contain summaries generated by the methods we created (TST, mT5-SC, M7B-POC).

    Text_thesis 
    - Bachelor thesis in .pdf and its LateX source code


!IMPORTANT! (For Application_and_libraries)
Modify config.cfg and set appropriate paths first, before executing any files.
Make sure config.cfg is in your working directory / Copy the config.cfg inside "Application_and_libraries" to your working directory before running any files in "Application_and_libraries".
By default, each paths in config.cfg are relative with the assumption that the structure of the files and folders is maintained.

*Due to size of each checkpoint, only third epoch checkpoint is made available.

**Due to the size of the SumeCzech dataset (3.2 GB for train set), only its test set will be provided in input_data folder. For complete SumeCzech dataset installation refer to: https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/sumeczech and their download scripts
