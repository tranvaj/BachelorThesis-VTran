!IMPORTANT! (For Application_and_libraries)
Modify config.cfg and set appropriate paths first, 
then copy config.cfg inside "Application_and_libraries" to your working directory before running any files in "Application_and_libraries".

*Due to size of each checkpoint, only third epoch checkpoint is made available.

**Due to the size of the SumeCzech dataset (3.2 GB for train set), only its test set will be provided in input_data folder. For complete SumeCzech dataset installation refer to: https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/sumeczech and their download scripts
