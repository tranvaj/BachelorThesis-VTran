Automatic Creation of Summaries of Historical Documents

Structure:
    Application_and_libraries 
    - Contains .py and .ipynb files for training and evaluation. Also contains M7B-SC and M7B-POC QLORAs (3rd checkpoint).
    - Contains simple .ipynb files for individual text summarization using mT5-SC, M7B-POC, and TST
    - Contains .py script for dataset generation using the provided Posel od ÄŒerchova journals in "\Input_data"
    - Contains singular "config.cfg" file for setting various constants and paths.
    - We used the following Jupyter Notebook image: cschranz/gpu-jupyter:v1.6_cuda-12.0_ubuntu-22.04 from https://github.com/iot-salzburg/gpu-jupyter 
    - If you are unfamiliar with .ipynb files, please check the Jupyter Notebook documentation https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/

    Input_data 
    - Contains data used for training, such as SumeCzech** and POC dataset and its various forms used during training such as POC_P or POC test set.

    Results 
    - Contains evaluation results for M7B-POC (3rd checkpoint), mT5-SC and TST and output files generated by application files.

    Text_thesis 
    - Bachelor thesis in .pdf and its LateX source code

HOW TO RUN:
    - Use Jupyter image "cschranz/gpu-jupyter:v1.6_cuda-12.0_ubuntu-22.04". Without it, you might need to manually install PyTorch, CUDA, and other necessary libraries.
    - Use Application_and_libraries/libraries_install.ipynb to install necessary libraries.
    - Run your desired .py or .ipynb file with config.cfg in your working directory.

!IMPORTANT! (For Application_and_libraries)
By default, each paths in config.cfg are relative with the assumption that the structure of the files and folders is maintained.
You should first look and at least replace "PLACE_YOUR_SUMECZECH_DATASET_LOCATION_HERE" with path to full installation of SumeCzech dataset and optionally "API_TOKEN" with your Hugging Face token in config.cfg.
Make sure config.cfg is in your working directory before running any files in "Application_and_libraries", otherwise the applications won't work!

*Due to size of each checkpoint, only third epoch checkpoint is made available.

**Due to the size of the SumeCzech dataset (3.2 GB for train set), only its test set will be provided in input_data folder. For complete SumeCzech dataset installation refer to: https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/sumeczech and their download scripts
